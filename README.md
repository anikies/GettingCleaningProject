####You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.    
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  


##### Running the script
1. Copy the run_analysis.R script to your working directory.  
2. Save the zip file containing the source data to your working directory.  
3. Open the zip file and copy the folder and its files to be a direct subfolder of your R working directory.  
4. Check that your working directory has UCI HAR Dataset as a subfolder.    
5. Run the script run_analysis.R
6. Examine tidyset.txt in the UCI HAR Dataset folder.
